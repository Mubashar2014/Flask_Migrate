   - Deserialized is not performed beacusae data was created through forms, as it's the process of converting the JSON or other format into python Object.

**10. Overall Conceptual Understanding:**
    - Demonstrated an in-depth understanding of Flask application development, ORM, migrations, and serialization/deserialization concepts.
    - Enhanced existing CRUD operations using Flask-Marshmallow.
